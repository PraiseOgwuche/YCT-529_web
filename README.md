# YCT-529: Advancing Male Contraception

This repository contains the website for my capstone research project on YCT-529, a promising non-hormonal male contraceptive targeting retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARα).

## Project Overview

This project represents the culmination of my undergraduate studies at Minerva University, exploring the potential of YCT-529 as a novel approach to male contraception. The research combines an extensive literature review with computational pharmacokinetic modeling to investigate how YCT-529 behaves across diverse populations and under different dosing conditions.

### Key Research Areas

- **Molecular Mechanism**: Analysis of how YCT-529 selectively inhibits RARα, disrupting spermatogenesis
- **Preclinical Efficacy**: Examination of its 99% sperm reduction rate in animal models
- **Population Pharmacokinetics**: Computational modeling of drug metabolism across ethnic groups
- **Dietary Effects**: Investigation of how food intake affects drug absorption and efficacy

## Website Structure

The website is organized into several key sections:

1. **Overview**: Executive summary of the project, highlighting key challenges and innovations
2. **Literature Review**: Comprehensive analysis of YCT-529's mechanism, signaling pathways, and efficacy
3. **Research Paper**: Details of the pharmacokinetic modeling research methodology and results
4. **Key Findings**: Summary of the most significant research outcomes and their implications
5. **About**: Project information, author details, and resource links

### Literature Review

The literature review provides a comprehensive analysis of YCT-529's molecular mechanisms, signaling pathways, and preclinical efficacy data. Key findings include:

- 99% reduction in sperm production in murine models
- Complete infertility achieved within 4 weeks of treatment
- Full fertility recovery 4-6 weeks post-withdrawal
- No effect on testosterone levels or sexual function
- Unique selectivity for RARα over RARβ and RARγ receptors

### Pharmacokinetic Research

The pharmacokinetic research employed PBPK modeling to characterize YCT-529's behavior across diverse populations and dosing regimens. Key findings include:

- Significant ethnic differences in drug metabolism (higher retention in East Asians)
- Dietary effects on absorption (higher peaks during fasting)
- Implications for population-specific dosing requirements

## Current Status

YCT-529 is currently in Phase 1 clinical trials in London (NCT06094283), with Phase 1b/2a trials planned (NCT06542237). The drug represents a promising alternative to hormonal male contraception with potential for fewer side effects and complete reversibility.
